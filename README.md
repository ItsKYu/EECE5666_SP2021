--Audio Files--
Audio_001 through Audio_003 are three different spoken words. Audio_004 is a low-E string played on a guitar. Audio_005 is a low-E string played on guitar and the spoken word "happy". Audio_006 is an attempt to sing the same note as the low-E string on the guitar. The last file is the spoken word "happy" with some low background noise. (Microphone placed by an open window in a Cambridge, MA neighborhood, some birds chirping are audible.)

The remaining audio files are the spoken word "happy" with some form of background noise, or spoken sentences from the “Harvard Sentences” List number 11 sentences 1 and 2 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1162058. Background noises that were tested were radio static, a small fan, acoustic guitar playing, and piano playing generated through a pair of speaker monitors.
