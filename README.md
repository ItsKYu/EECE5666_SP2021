--Audio Files--
The audio files utilized for input signals have been stored in the main repository. This includes well known and studied sentences from Harvard University. These were selected based on criteria outlined in the main report. 

They are listed as: 

harvard_11_1.wav -> Clean audio of Harvard Sentences List 11 Line 1.
harvard_11_2.wav -> Clean audio of Harvard Sentences List 11 Line 2.
harvard_62_9.wav -> Clean audio of Harvard Sentences List 62 Line 9.
noisy_harvard_11_1.wav -> Noisy audio of Harvard Sentences List 11 Line 1. 
noisy_harvard_11_2.wav -> Noisy audio of Harvard Sentences List 11 Line 2. 
noisy_harvard_62_9.wav -> Noisy audio of Harvard Sentences List 62 Line 9. 

The deep learning code utilized for these signals can also be found in the main branch. 

The processed and denoised counterparts to these files can be found in the "Denoised Audio" branch. 

The finalized filtering and VAD code for this project can be found in the "Finalized Code" branch. 

Data figures not included in the report can be found in the "Figures" branch. 

--Hardware and Software for Data Collection--
A Google Pixel 3XL phone was used as a microphone with the Audio Recorder free app from the Google Play Store. Link to the app and app support are no longer available.
MATLAB deep-learning and VAD toolboxes used for analysis. 
MATLAB filtering commands and techniques used for analysis.
